# UI Context

## Direction

theBuilderStudio uses a restrained, professional mobile visual language inspired by clear professional-network products while retaining the Builder Uni logo palette.

The current interface is light mode only.

## Visual Hierarchy

- neutral light page background
- white cards, fields, and bottom navigation
- black primary and secondary typography
- neutral borders and subtle shadows
- orange for primary actions and focused emphasis
- violet for selected navigation, focus states, supporting badges, and small accent slices

Avoid large orange or violet backgrounds. Avoid dim/gray text. Avoid decorative colored strips on cards.

## Current Tokens

| Orange dark | `AppColors.primaryDark` | `#D94A08` |
| Orange soft | `AppColors.primarySoft` / `accentSoft` | `#FFF0E8` |
| Violet | `AppColors.violet` / `secondary` | `#5B20E5` |
| Violet soft | `AppColors.violetSoft` | `#EEE8FF` |
| Background | `AppColors.background` | `#F4F2F1` |
| Surface | `AppColors.surface` | `#FFFFFF` |
| Text | `AppColors.textPrimary` / `textSecondary` | `#000000` |

## Typography

`AppTheme` declares Inter as the app family and uses bold, black headings with black body/label text. If custom font files are later bundled, configure them in `pubspec.yaml`; do not assume a declared family is embedded when it is not.
